This is a version of Bowling Game Kata in python and his purpose is just to practice TDD

I created a makefile to help development then to execute just type: 'make run'
I'm using 'pytest' for the tests
I'm using 'pylint' for static code analisys
I'm using 'mypy' for checking the type hintings in python
I'm using 'pdb' for debug
